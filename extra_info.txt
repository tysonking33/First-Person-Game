3) ./opengl-template


To integrate new `.cpp` and `.hpp` files into your project, you need to update your `CMakeLists.txt` file to include these new source files in your build process. Here's how you can modify your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.11 FATAL_ERROR)
project(OpenGLTemplate CXX)

# List your new source files
set(new_sources 
    ${SOURCE_DIR}/new_file.cpp
    ${SOURCE_DIR}/new_file.hpp
    # Add more .cpp and .hpp files as needed
)

# Append the new sources to the existing sources variable
list(APPEND sources ${new_sources})

# Rest of your CMakeLists.txt file remains unchanged...
```

Replace `"${SOURCE_DIR}/new_file.cpp"` and `"${SOURCE_DIR}/new_file.hpp"` with the actual paths to your new `.cpp` and `.hpp` files. Then, when you run `cmake --build .`, CMake will compile these new source files along with the existing ones, and you'll be able to use the functionality defined in them within your project.
